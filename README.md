# Unhandled Error in Asynchronous Express.js Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications using Express.js: unhandled errors in asynchronous middleware. The provided code simulates an asynchronous operation that might fail.  If the simulated operation fails, an error is thrown inside a `setTimeout` callback. Because this error is not properly caught within the middleware chain, it can lead to unexpected application crashes or silent failures, making debugging difficult.

The solution provided shows a way to properly handle asynchronous errors, ensuring robust error handling and preventing the application from crashing.
